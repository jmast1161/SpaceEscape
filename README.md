# SpaceEscape
Survive as long as you can before the UFO catches you.  
Retrieve fuel capsules to add to your fuel supply.  
A new capsule is available every three seconds.
As you capture more fuel capsules, the UFO becomes more aware of your position and will travel faster to get you!
Don't sit idly by as when your fuel reaches zero, you will become stranded in space.
Power ups will be available to grant you help on your escape.
  -A fuel stopper will momentarily freeze your fuel consumption.
  -A cloaking device will hide you from the UFO until you cross paths.
  -A decelerator will slow down the UFO.
